# swipe-buddy
Proof of concept script that automates swiping on tinder.

Swipe Buddy assigns points based on criteria like number of photos, interests or length of the bio, then it 'swipes right' on all profiles with score above the median.

More than attempting to rate the people behind them, it tries to filter out the low-effort profiles (which there are plenty of).

## Disclaimer
I wrote this script as a proof of concept.

It is possible to run it on any account, but a valid access token is required and I won't provide information on how to get it.

*As a matter of my personal opinion*, it's sad enough how easy the system is to exploit and how little the companies owning it do to protect the users' experience, considering it plays an important part in a lot of people's lives
