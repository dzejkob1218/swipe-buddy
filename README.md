# swipe-buddy
Here's a quick script that automates the tedious task of swiping profiles on tinder.

Swipe buddy assigns points based on criteria like number of photos, interests or length of bio, then it 'swipes right' on all profiles with score above the median.

More than attempting to rate any particular aspect of a profile, it tries to filter out all the low-effort profiles (which there are plenty of).

## Disclaimer
I wrote this script as a proof of concept.

It is possible to run it on your account, but to do so, a valid access token has to be stored in the environment and I'm not going to provide information on how to get it.

*As a matter of my personal opinion*, the users of tinder have no choice but to put their trust in a system which is laughably simple to exploit. It's sad how little is done to protect the user's experience by the companies owning these applications, as opposed to the enormous role they play in our social lives. Please don't use this code to contribute to the problem. Most people wouldn't appreciate having their social interactions initiated by a machine.
